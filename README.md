> A toolkit providing minimal-cost abstractions of well-established patterns for trait object operations that aren't supported by rust's trait system directly, such as cloning, comparison, and conversion

</div>

## Features

| Feature     | Status      | Description         |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| `clone_box` | âœ… Available | `clone_box` pattern |
| comparison  | ðŸš§ Planned  |                     |
| conversion  | ðŸš§ Planned  |                     |

## Usage

This crate provides procedural macros that enhance rust traits by enabling operations that aren't natively supported for trait objects. Currently, the sole feature is the
`clone_box` attribute, which enables cloning of trait objects with minimal abstraction overhead beyond the unavoidable dynamic dispatch.

```rust
use traitkit::clone_box;

#[clone_box]
pub trait MyTrait {}
```

## Example

Here's a simple example showing how to use the `clone_box` attribute to create clonable trait objects without the boilerplate:

```rust
use traitkit::clone_box;

#[clone_box]
pub trait Animal {
    fn speak(&self) -> String;
}

#[derive(Clone)]
struct Dog {
    name: String,
}

impl Animal for Dog {
    fn speak(&self) -> String {
        format!("{} says: Woof!", self.name)
    }
}

#[derive(Clone)]
struct Cat {
    name: String,
}

impl Animal for Cat {
    fn speak(&self) -> String {
        format!("{} says: Meow!", self.name)
    }
}

fn main() {
    // create a vector of trait objects
    let animals: Vec<Box<dyn Animal>> = vec![
        Box::new(Dog { name: "Buddy".to_string() }),
        Box::new(Cat { name: "Whiskers".to_string() }),
    ];

    // clone the vector of trait objects 
    // (this is where the clone_box pattern comes in handy)
    let cloned_animals = animals.clone();

    // both vecs work as you'd expect
    for animal in &animals {
        println!("Original: {}", animal.speak());
    }

    for animal in &cloned_animals {
        println!("Cloned: {}", animal.speak());
    }
}
```

### In practice

You can use the `clone_box` method directly or access it through the standard `Clone` trait:

```rust
// using standard clone trait (which the macro handles for you)
let cloned = my_trait_object.clone();

// using the explicit method
let cloned = my_trait_object.clone_box();
```

## The problem

> *For those new to rust's trait object limitations:*

In rust, trait objects (`dyn Trait`) have fundamental limitations due to type erasure and rust's object safety rules. Specifically:

- Trait objects cannot automatically implement marker traits like `Clone`, `Eq`, or
  `Hash`, even when every possible implementor satisfies these bounds, because:
    - The concrete type information is erased at runtime (stored only as a vtable pointer)
    - The compiler cannot verify at compile time that all current and future implementors will satisfy these bounds
    - rust's trait object design intentionally limits which methods are accessible through the vtable

- The `Box<dyn Animal>` cannot be cloned even when all concrete types implement `Clone` because:
    - The `Clone` implementation would need to know the concrete type to call its specific clone method
    - The trait object vtable only contains entries for methods explicitly defined in the trait itself

- Traditional workarounds require:
    - Manual auxiliary traits with explicit `clone_box`-style methods
    - Complex trait bounds and blanket implementations
    - Careful attention to object safety concerns
    - Sometimes unsafe code for downcasting via `Any` or similar mechanisms (with potential performance penalties)

These limitations can make working with trait objects cumbersome in scenarios where operations like cloning (currently handled with the
`clone_box` pattern macro), comparison (todo), or conversion (todo) are needed.

## Pros & Cons

### Pros

1. **Type-system friendly**:
   Creates auxiliary trait implementations that work with rust's type system to keep static dispatch for concrete types, only using dynamic dispatch at trait object boundaries where it's unavoidable.

2. **Static type guarantees**:
   Maintains, where possible, rust's type system through trait bounds, for example for the clone_box pattern, by enforcing implementors be
   `Clone + 'static` without runtime checks.
3. **Minimal overhead abstractions**:
   Introduces no overhead beyond the inherent dynamic dispatch required when working with trait objects. Avoids additional indirection layers or heap allocations that would degrade performance compared to a manually written implementation.
4. **Reduces manual boilerplate**:
   Replaces error-prone manual auxiliary traits, blanket implementations, and explicit method forwarding typically needed for the clone_box pattern.

5. **Optimized dispatch implementation**:
   Implements patterns like clone_box using direct trait method calls rather than type erasure techniques such as
   `Any` downcasting. This approach produces more analyzable IR for compiler backends, avoiding additional optimization barriers beyond the inherent limitations of trait objects.

6. **Centralized implementation**:
   Consolidates some potentially complex trait implementation details in a single location, eliminating duplicated logic across different traits requiring the same pattern (and potential for user error/inconsistent implementations because of that).

7. **Focus on preserving object safety**:
   Avoids self-referential methods, associated types without bounds, or other features that would violate object safety requirements.

### Cons

1. **Procedural Macro Dependency**:
   Adds a procedural macro dependency to your project, which will increase compile times, even if only slightly. They can easily build up, so be mindful of that.

2. **Additional Generated Traits**:
   Creates auxiliary traits in your codebase that could potentially lead to name conflicts or increase the binary size.

3. **Implicit Code Generation**:
   The auto-generated implementations may make it less obvious what's happening under the hood compared to manual implementations. But that's also a pro. It's a two-edged sword.

4. **Still Developing Features**:
   Currently only implements the clone_box pattern, with other patterns still in planning.

5. **Trait Object Limitations**:
   Still bound by rust's fundamental trait object constraints. Not a magic bullet, just a convenience for some common patterns.

6. **Strict Trait Bounds**:
   Imposes specific trait bounds (like
   `Clone + 'static`) which might be more restrictive than a bespoke manual implementation for some cases.

7. **Learning Curve for Debugging**:
   Requires understanding the underlying pattern to effectively work through possible issues. Some of the quirks that come with the territory may not be immediately obvious to those who don't know the pattern, which can cause frustration.

> **Note:** Performance benchmarks comparing this implementation to manual approaches
> will be added before the first minor release `0.1`. Current "minimal overhead" claims are based
> on analysis of the generated code rather than quantitative measurements.

## Compatibility

This crate requires a minimum version of `1.6.4` for the rust toolchain.

We strive to keep the msrv as low and as widely compatible as possible, but sometimes big enough benefits can be gained by using certain newer features.

For this crate, for pragmatic reasons, we pin the msrv to
`1.6.4` to have the crate management niceties of the version's stabilised `workspace-inheritance` feature.

This is ensured via ci/cd which verifies the compatibility with the msrv each time a new version of this crate is released.
